# DiJetJERC
This is module for JER and JEC studies with dijet events. 
It contains:
- UHH2 module for preselection, which is the same for JER SF and relative residulas (L2Res JEC) 
- Set of scripts for L2Res analysis
- Set of scripts for JER SF

Due to historical reasons, set of script and way of running them is different at the moment. 

TBA: short instruction for each part
