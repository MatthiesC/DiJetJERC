# DiJetJERC
This is module for JER and JEC studies with dijet events. 
It contains:
- UHH2 module for preselection (AnalysisModule_DiJetTrg), which is the same for JER SF and relative L2Res residulas JEC
- Set of scripts for L2Res analysis in L2Res_Analysis
- Set of scripts for JER SF analysis in JERSF_Analysis

Due to historical reasons, set of script and way of running them is different at the moment.
